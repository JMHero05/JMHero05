# Hello, World! <img src="images/hand-wave.gif" width="30px"> #

<p>I'm a former Broadway National Touring Actor based out of NYC, and have successfully transitioned into a new career, software engineering, with Reveal Mobile. While attending the Flatiron School, I grew as a developer learning Ruby on Rails, Javascript, React.js, Redux, and a hankering for learning new technologies. I am excited to use my creativity and leadership skills developed over the last ten years and my software engineering knowledge to further my growth as a developer.</p>
